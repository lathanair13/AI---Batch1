Reading Assignment

1) Read about the different types of open source licenses and learn what are the do's and don'ts 
of using opne source in your project

2) Familiarize about 'Iris' Data set widely used for ML beginners education


Python


1.consider the matrix A with the values,
	a = ([['Rhia',10,20,30,40,50],
           ['Alan',75,80,75,85,100],
           ['Smith',80,80,80,90,95]])
 perform the following operations and print the resulting matrix.
	1. slice the matrix and the output will be  
 	 	[['Rhia',10],
  		['Alan',75],
  		['Smith',80]]
	2. update third row as ['Sam',82,79,88,97,99]
	3. replace the 4th element of first row as 95
	4. add a new column in this matrix with the following values, 73, 80 and 85.

2. Consider the following sentence,

#Python is an interpreted high level programming language for general-purpose programming*.

i) remove all special characters from this.
ii) Print all   palindromes in the sentence
iii) print the repeating words and  number of times it repeats  

3. Given two sets A and B,
   A = {5, 3, 8, 6, 1}
   B = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2}
      Perform the following operations and print the resulting set,
	i) union
	ii) intersection
	iii) set difference
	iv) find maximum and the minimum value of set A and B

4. Write a program to print the prime numbers in the interval 900-1000, and also find if any palindrome is in the result.
